## Description

This Flask application serves as a foundation for building an API that can handle JSON data. It provides endpoints for storing, retrieving, and interacting with JSON data. The application includes the following key components:

- **`app_flask.py`**: The main Flask application that defines API endpoints and data handling.
- **`get.py`**: A Python script for making GET requests to retrieve data from the API.
- **`env.py`**: A Python script for making POST requests to send data to the API.
- **`chat.py`**: A Python script for sending chat messages to the API.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```shell
  https://github.com/d4v1-sudo/flask-json-api.git
  ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required packages:

  ```shell
  cd flask-json-api
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Start the Flask application:

  ```shell
  python3 app_flask.py
  ```

The Flask application will run locally, and you can interact with it using the provided Python scripts (`get.py`, `env.py`, and `chat.py`).

## Usage

You can use the provided Python scripts to interact with the Flask API. Here's a brief overview of their usage:

- **`get.py`**: Use this script to make GET requests and retrieve data from the API.

- **`env.py`**: Use this script to make POST requests and send data to the API.

- **`chat.py`**: Use this script to send chat messages to the API.

Make sure to replace the placeholder URLs and routes in the scripts with your own API endpoint details.
